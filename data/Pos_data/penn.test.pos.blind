A/_ good/_ bet/_ would/_ be/_ the/_ tension/_ between/_ blacks/_ and/_ Jews/_ in/_ New/_ York/_ City/_ ./_
Or/_ so/_ it/_ must/_ seem/_ to/_ Jackie/_ Mason/_ ,/_ the/_ veteran/_ Jewish/_ comedian/_ appearing/_ in/_ a/_ new/_ ABC/_ sitcom/_ airing/_ on/_ Tuesday/_ nights/_ -LRB-/_ 9:30-10/_ p.m./_ EDT/_ -RRB-/_ ./_
Not/_ only/_ is/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ the/_ star/_ of/_ ``/_ Chicken/_ Soup/_ ,/_ ''/_ he/_ 's/_ also/_ the/_ inheritor/_ of/_ a/_ comedic/_ tradition/_ dating/_ back/_ to/_ ``/_ Duck/_ Soup/_ ,/_ ''/_ and/_ he/_ 's/_ currently/_ a/_ man/_ in/_ hot/_ water/_ ./_
Here/_ ,/_ in/_ neutral/_ language/_ ,/_ is/_ the/_ gist/_ of/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ 's/_ remarks/_ ,/_ quoted/_ first/_ in/_ the/_ Village/_ Voice/_ while/_ he/_ was/_ a/_ paid/_ spokesman/_ for/_ the/_ Rudolph/_ Giuliani/_ mayoral/_ campaign/_ ,/_ and/_ then/_ in/_ Newsweek/_ after/_ he/_ and/_ the/_ campaign/_ parted/_ company/_ ./_

He/_ said/_ that/_ many/_ black/_ voters/_ feel/_ bitter/_ about/_ racial/_ discrimination/_ ,/_ so/_ they/_ ,/_ too/_ ,/_ support/_ black/_ candidates/_ uncritically/_ ./_
He/_ said/_ that/_ Jews/_ have/_ contributed/_ more/_ to/_ black/_ causes/_ over/_ the/_ years/_ than/_ vice/_ versa/_ ./_
Of/_ course/_ ,/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ did/_ not/_ use/_ neutral/_ language/_ ./_
As/_ a/_ practitioner/_ of/_ ethnic/_ humor/_ from/_ the/_ old/_ days/_ on/_ the/_ Borscht/_ Belt/_ ,/_ live/_ television/_ and/_ the/_ nightclub/_ circuit/_ ,/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ instinctively/_ reached/_ for/_ the/_ vernacular/_ ./_
He/_ said/_ Jews/_ were/_ ``/_ sick/_ with/_ complexes/_ ''/_ ;/_ and/_ he/_ called/_ David/_ Dinkins/_ ,/_ Mr./_ Giuliani/_ 's/_ black/_ opponent/_ ,/_ ``/_ a/_ fancy/_ shvartze/_ with/_ a/_ mustache/_ ./_ ''/_
If/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ had/_ used/_ less/_ derogatory/_ language/_ to/_ articulate/_ his/_ amateur/_ analysis/_ of/_ the/_ voting/_ behavior/_ of/_ his/_ fellow/_ New/_ Yorkers/_ ,/_ would/_ the/_ water/_ be/_ quite/_ so/_ hot/_ ?/_
It/_ probably/_ would/_ ,/_ because/_ few/_ or/_ none/_ of/_ the/_ people/_ upset/_ by/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ 's/_ remarks/_ have/_ bothered/_ to/_ distinguish/_ between/_ the/_ substance/_ of/_ his/_ comments/_ and/_ the/_ fact/_ that/_ he/_ used/_ insulting/_ language/_ ./_
In/_ addition/_ ,/_ some/_ of/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ 's/_ critics/_ have/_ implied/_ that/_ his/_ type/_ of/_ ethnic/_ humor/_ is/_ itself/_ a/_ form/_ of/_ racism/_ ./_
For/_ example/_ ,/_ the/_ New/_ York/_ state/_ counsel/_ for/_ the/_ NAACP/_ said/_ that/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ is/_ ``/_ like/_ a/_ dinosaur/_ ./_
People/_ are/_ fast/_ leaving/_ the/_ place/_ where/_ he/_ is/_ stuck/_ ./_ ''/_
These/_ critics/_ fail/_ to/_ distinguish/_ between/_ the/_ type/_ of/_ ethnic/_ humor/_ that/_ aims/_ at/_ disparaging/_ another/_ group/_ ,/_ such/_ as/_ ``/_ Polish/_ jokes/_ ''/_ ;/_ and/_ the/_ type/_ that/_ is/_ double-edged/_ ,/_ aiming/_ inward/_ as/_ well/_ as/_ outward/_ ./_
The/_ latter/_ typically/_ is/_ the/_ humor/_ of/_ the/_ underdog/_ ,/_ and/_ it/_ was/_ perfected/_ by/_ both/_ blacks/_ and/_ Jews/_ on/_ the/_ minstrel/_ and/_ vaudeville/_ stage/_ as/_ a/_ means/_ of/_ mocking/_ their/_ white/_ and/_ gentile/_ audiences/_ along/_ with/_ themselves/_ ./_
In/_ the/_ hands/_ of/_ a/_ zealot/_ like/_ Lenny/_ Bruce/_ ,/_ this/_ double-edged/_ blade/_ could/_ cut/_ both/_ the/_ self/_ and/_ the/_ audience/_ to/_ ribbons/_ ./_
But/_ wielded/_ by/_ a/_ pro/_ like/_ Jackie/_ Mason/_ ,/_ it/_ is/_ a/_ constructive/_ form/_ of/_ mischief/_ ./_
Why/_ constructive/_ ?/_
Because/_ despite/_ all/_ the/_ media/_ prattle/_ about/_ comedy/_ and/_ politics/_ not/_ mixing/_ ,/_ they/_ are/_ similar/_ in/_ one/_ respect/_ :/_ Both/_ can/_ serve/_ as/_ mechanisms/_ for/_ easing/_ tensions/_ and/_ facilitating/_ the/_ co-existence/_ of/_ groups/_ in/_ conflict/_ ./_
That/_ 's/_ why/_ it/_ 's/_ dangerous/_ to/_ have/_ well-intentioned/_ thought/_ police/_ ,/_ on/_ college/_ campuses/_ and/_ elsewhere/_ ,/_ taboo/_ all/_ critical/_ mention/_ of/_ group/_ differences/_ ./_
As/_ Elizabeth/_ Kristol/_ wrote/_ in/_ the/_ New/_ York/_ Times/_ just/_ before/_ the/_ Mason/_ donnybrook/_ ,/_ ``/_ Perhaps/_ intolerance/_ would/_ not/_ boil/_ over/_ with/_ such/_ intensity/_ if/_ honest/_ differences/_ were/_ allowed/_ to/_ simmer/_ ./_ ''/_
The/_ question/_ is/_ ,/_ if/_ group/_ conflicts/_ still/_ exist/_ -LRB-/_ as/_ undeniably/_ they/_ do/_ -RRB-/_ ,/_ and/_ if/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ 's/_ type/_ of/_ ethnic/_ humor/_ is/_ passe/_ ,/_ then/_ what/_ other/_ means/_ do/_ we/_ have/_ for/_ letting/_ off/_ steam/_ ?/_
Do/_ n't/_ say/_ the/_ TV/_ sitcom/_ ,/_ because/_ that/_ happens/_ to/_ be/_ a/_ genre/_ that/_ ,/_ in/_ its/_ desperate/_ need/_ to/_ attract/_ everybody/_ and/_ offend/_ nobody/_ ,/_ resembles/_ politics/_ more/_ than/_ it/_ does/_ comedy/_ ./_
It/_ is/_ true/_ that/_ the/_ best/_ sitcoms/_ do/_ allow/_ group/_ differences/_ to/_ simmer/_ :/_ yuppies/_ vs./_ blue-collar/_ Bostonians/_ in/_ ``/_ Cheers/_ ''/_ ;/_ children/_ vs./_ adults/_ in/_ ``/_ The/_ Cosby/_ Show/_ ./_ ''/_
But/_ these/_ are/_ not/_ the/_ differences/_ that/_ make/_ headlines/_ ./_
In/_ ``/_ Chicken/_ Soup/_ ,/_ ''/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ plays/_ Jackie/_ ,/_ a/_ Jewish/_ bachelor/_ courting/_ Maddie/_ -LRB-/_ Lynn/_ Redgrave/_ -RRB-/_ ,/_ an/_ Irish/_ widow/_ and/_ mother/_ of/_ three/_ ,/_ against/_ the/_ wishes/_ of/_ his/_ mother/_ -LRB-/_ Rita/_ Karin/_ -RRB-/_ and/_ her/_ brother/_ Michael/_ -LRB-/_ Brandon/_ Maggart/_ -RRB-/_ ./_
It/_ 's/_ worth/_ noting/_ that/_ both/_ disapproving/_ relatives/_ are/_ immigrants/_ ./_
At/_ least/_ ,/_ they/_ both/_ speak/_ with/_ strong/_ accents/_ ,/_ as/_ do/_ Jackie/_ and/_ Maddie/_ ./_
It/_ could/_ n't/_ be/_ more/_ obvious/_ that/_ ``/_ Chicken/_ Soup/_ ''/_ is/_ being/_ made/_ from/_ an/_ old/_ recipe/_ ./_
And/_ a/_ safe/_ one/_ --/_ imagine/_ if/_ the/_ romance/_ in/_ question/_ were/_ between/_ an/_ Orthodox/_ Jew/_ and/_ a/_ member/_ of/_ the/_ Nation/_ of/_ Islam/_ ./_
Back/_ in/_ the/_ 1920s/_ ,/_ the/_ play/_ and/_ movie/_ versions/_ of/_ ``/_ Abie/_ 's/_ Irish/_ Rose/_ ''/_ made/_ the/_ theme/_ of/_ courtship/_ between/_ the/_ assimilated/_ offspring/_ of/_ Jewish/_ and/_ Irish/_ immigrants/_ so/_ popular/_ that/_ its/_ author/_ ,/_ Anne/_ Nichols/_ ,/_ lost/_ a/_ plagiarism/_ suit/_ on/_ the/_ grounds/_ that/_ the/_ plot/_ has/_ entered/_ the/_ public/_ domain/_ ./_
And/_ it/_ has/_ remained/_ there/_ ,/_ as/_ evidenced/_ by/_ its/_ reappearance/_ in/_ a/_ 1972/_ CBS/_ sitcom/_ called/_ ``/_ Bridget/_ Loves/_ Bernie/_ ,/_ ''/_ whose/_ sole/_ distinction/_ was/_ that/_ it/_ led/_ to/_ the/_ real-life/_ marriage/_ of/_ Meredith/_ Baxter/_ and/_ David/_ Birney/_ ./_
Clearly/_ ,/_ the/_ question/_ with/_ ``/_ Chicken/_ Soup/_ ''/_ is/_ not/_ whether/_ the/_ pot/_ will/_ boil/_ over/_ ,/_ but/_ whether/_ it/_ will/_ simmer/_ at/_ all/_ ./_
So/_ far/_ ,/_ the/_ bubbles/_ have/_ been/_ few/_ and/_ far/_ between/_ ./_
Part/_ of/_ the/_ problem/_ is/_ the/_ tendency/_ of/_ all/_ sitcoms/_ ,/_ ever/_ since/_ the/_ didactic/_ days/_ of/_ Norman/_ Lear/_ ,/_ to/_ preach/_ about/_ social/_ issues/_ ./_
To/_ some/_ extent/_ ,/_ this/_ tendency/_ emerges/_ whenever/_ the/_ show/_ tries/_ to/_ enlighten/_ us/_ about/_ ethnic/_ stereotypes/_ by/_ reversing/_ them/_ ./_
For/_ instance/_ ,/_ Michael/_ dislikes/_ Jackie/_ not/_ because/_ he/_ 's/_ a/_ shrewd/_ Jewish/_ businessman/_ ,/_ but/_ because/_ he/_ quits/_ his/_ well-paying/_ job/_ as/_ a/_ salesman/_ in/_ order/_ to/_ become/_ a/_ social/_ worker/_ ./_
Even/_ more/_ problematic/_ is/_ the/_ incompatibility/_ between/_ sitcom/_ preachiness/_ and/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ 's/_ comic/_ persona/_ ./_
The/_ best/_ moments/_ in/_ the/_ show/_ occur/_ at/_ the/_ beginning/_ and/_ the/_ end/_ -LRB-/_ and/_ occasionally/_ in/_ the/_ middle/_ -RRB-/_ ,/_ when/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ slips/_ into/_ his/_ standup/_ mode/_ and/_ starts/_ meting/_ out/_ that/_ old-fashioned/_ Jewish/_ mischief/_ to/_ other/_ people/_ as/_ well/_ as/_ to/_ himself/_ ./_
But/_ too/_ often/_ ,/_ these/_ routines/_ lack/_ spark/_ because/_ this/_ sitcom/_ ,/_ like/_ all/_ sitcoms/_ ,/_ is/_ timid/_ about/_ confronting/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ 's/_ stock/_ in/_ trade/_ -/_ ethnic/_ differences/_ ./_
I/_ 'm/_ not/_ suggesting/_ that/_ the/_ producers/_ start/_ putting/_ together/_ episodes/_ about/_ topics/_ like/_ the/_ Catholic-Jewish/_ dispute/_ over/_ the/_ Carmelite/_ convent/_ at/_ Auschwitz/_ ./_
That/_ issue/_ ,/_ like/_ racial/_ tensions/_ in/_ New/_ York/_ City/_ ,/_ will/_ have/_ to/_ cool/_ down/_ ,/_ not/_ heat/_ up/_ ,/_ before/_ it/_ can/_ simmer/_ ./_
But/_ I/_ am/_ suggesting/_ that/_ they/_ stop/_ requiring/_ Mr./_ Mason/_ to/_ interrupt/_ his/_ classic/_ shtik/_ with/_ some/_ line/_ about/_ ``/_ caring/_ for/_ other/_ people/_ ''/_ that/_ would/_ sound/_ shmaltzy/_ on/_ the/_ lips/_ of/_ Miss/_ America/_ ./_
